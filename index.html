        <h2>Interests</h2>
        <p>In my free time, I enjoy staying active and engaged with various hobbies. One of my greatest passions is playing sports, particularly table tennis and throwball. Both sports challenge my reflexes and coordination, while providing a fun and competitive outlet. When I am not on the court, I love reading articles on diverse topics, from technology to personal development, as it helps broaden my knowledge and perspective. Additionally, I find solace in listening to music, which serves as a source of relaxation and inspiration. Music helps me unwind and stay motivated, whether I'm working on a project or simply enjoying some quiet time.</p>
